<p>Terminator Genisys was interesting. It takes this weird position that Terminator 3 and 4 never happened. I doubt however that hardcore Terminator fans could actually tell you what that difference means for the continuity. Genisys says to continuity: <em>shrug</em>. The characters mention in the outtro monologue that they themselves haven’t figured all of it out yet. Echos the MST3k sentiment of </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if you’re wondering how Joel eats and breaths, and other science facts, repeat to yourself it’s just a show, you should really just relax”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure that won’t quell angry fan boys. But really Terminator Genisys is really fun at parts, and at parts stands equal to T2. Those points I feel is when it’s most heavily impersonating T2. </p>
<p>There’s 4 different times in the film 1984, 1997, 2017. Each year has a different color filter. 1984 matches the first Terminator film. 1997, T2. 2017: Instagram. In the future, as well as the present all films are shot in instagram. </p>
<p>In 1991 when James Cameron made Terminator 2, heavy color filtering was still a new thing and directors could still use it tastefully. For horrible examples, see Terminator 4 and that pile of shit Ferngully knock-off Avatar. In Genisys, it’s not totally offensive but it works. </p>
<p>There’s a genuine feeling as they go through this film that they’re trying to expand the storyline to expand past what they’ve done with the previous films. Rather than just non-stop John Connor getting hunted, they’ll revisit the first Terminator and show it from a different perspective, those new perspectives echo into results in the future. That’s neat. </p>
<p>Terminator 3 felt like a $2 version of terminator. T3’s “more advanced” terminators were weaker, goofier, and cheaper seeming than the liquid metal T-1000s. T3 in a nutshell was “there’s the terminator, run!” “oh shit, there she is again, run!” (rinse repeat). Genisys at least made the tech more terrifying and kept some level of cohesion and budget with the first two movies. </p>
<p>There was a couple of points in the film when Emilia Clarke was doing a Linda Hamilton impression, which was cool. But Linda Hamilton in T2 was a buff brute and Emilia Clarke looks like a cuddler. Her arms have no muscle, which I’m sure might have looked bad on her in game of thrones, but couldn’t the CGI department give her some bicepts? She’s been preparing for the apocolypse since she was 9 years old and has done less push ups that she does in the mental institution in T2. </p>
<p>There’s a scene where they go into this secret weapons cache that has been there for 20 years that Pops set up for them. First thing they have to do? Start putting bullets in magazines. There was a fucking terminator hanging out for 20 years and he couldn’t get these fucking bullets in clips? What the fuck, talk about waiting until the last minute. </p>
<p>Skynet, you don’t have to mimic human form and talk to people while they’re trying to kill you. Why not do something to try to kill your enemies instead of wasting the CPU cycles to appear to grow older. There was a point in that same sequence where Sarah Connor and Reese are like “oh no, we’ve got 4 minutes left!” - I totally thought they were going to start banging to make John Connor. Sadly, it didn’t happen. </p>
<p>The movie was decent but flawed, I hope they make the 2 sequels that have been outlined because I’ll throw another $10 at the franchise.  </p>
